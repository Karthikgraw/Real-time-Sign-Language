# Real-time-Sign-Language
Real-Time Sign Language Recognition Using Deep Learning and Computer Vision presents
a comprehensive approach to developing a real-time sign language detection system using
deep learning and computer vision techniques. The primary goal is to create a model capable
of accurately recognizing and classifying various sign language gestures in real-time using a
webcam. The process begins with the collection of a diverse dataset of sign language gestures, 
followed by training a convolutional neural network (CNN) using the MobileNetV2
architecture. Data augmentation techniques are employed to enhance the model's
generalization capabilities. The trained model is then integrated into a real-time detection
system that leverages the MediaPipe library for hand tracking and landmark detection. The
system processes video input from a webcam, detects hand landmarks, and uses the trained
model to predict the corresponding gesture. The effectiveness of the system is demonstrated
through high accuracy in gesture recognition and smooth real-time performance. This project
lays the foundation for more advanced sign language recognition applications, with potential
future work including the expansion of the gesture vocabulary and optimization for
deployment on mobile and embedded devices.
